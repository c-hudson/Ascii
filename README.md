TeenyMUSH
~~~~~~~~~
     This is an implementation of a TinyMUSH like server in Perl and
MySQL. The server can be used to create an ASCII based virtual world.
Users can telnet into the server and interact with other users in a world
of their creation. Customization of the world does not require
modification of the internal server code. 

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Run the create.sh to create the mysql peices and the tm_config.dat.
This will create you a god character with a password of portrzebie, and an
initial room. The rest is for you to create.
