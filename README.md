TeenyMUSH

      This server code can be used to implement ASCII based virtual world.
Users may  where telnet into the server and interact with other users.
The world can be customized to meet the needs of its owner and/or users
without modifying internal server code. Typically users will use a client
program such as TinyFugue to connect to the server to make the
interaction easier.
