TeenyMUSH
~~~~~~~~~
     This is an implementation of a TinyMUSH like server in Perl and
MySQL. The server can be used to create a ASCII based virtual world.
Users can telnet into the server and interact with other users in a world
of their creation. Customization of the world does not require
modification of the internal server code. 

see http://teenymush.blogspot.in/ for more details.
