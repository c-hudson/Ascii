TeenyMUSH
~~~~~~~~~
     This is an implementation of a TinyMUSH like server in Perl and
MySQL. The server can be used to create an ASCII based virtual world.
Users can telnet into the server and interact with other users in a world
of their creation. Customization of the world does not require
modification of the internal server code. 

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Run the create.sh to create the mysql peices and the tm_config.dat.
This will create a god character with a password of portrzebie, and an
initial room. Then run the "tm" perl script.

Setup
~~~~~
     There are a few special attributes that control how TeenyMUSH
runs. These typically were set in the netmush.conf but are now stored
inside the database on object #0.
