   =====================================================================
& basics
You've connected to a MUSH, so now what do you do? Well, MUSHes
are broken up into many different rooms. There's many different ways
to interact in a room or people within a room. Lets start with a few
important commands to interact with the things around you.

look
   This command will tell you about the room your currently in.
   It should list a description of the room, contents of the room,
   and a list of exits on how to get out of the room.

go <direction>
   Traveling through an exit to another room.

say <message>
   Say something to the people in your current room.

"<message>
   A shortened version of the say command. This alias will save you
   a few clicks on the keyboard.

pose <message>
   Perform an action like smiling by typing in: pose smiles

:<message>
   a shortened version of the pose command.

whisper <person> = <message>
   Want to say something to a particular person? Whisper it to them
   and no one else will hear it. This only works with people in the
   same room.

WHO
   Not everyone on-line will be in the same room as you, the WHO
   command lists everyone connected to the MUSH.

page <person> = <message>
   Send a message to a person in any room 
& topics
    basics
& "
command:

   "<message>

Says <message> to everyone in your current location.

Example:              |   Output
===========================================================
                      |
"Hello.               |   You say, "Hello"

Also see: say
& &
command:

   &<attribute> <object> = <text>

This command is used to store information on an object. The text
may be either generic information or Mushcode. <text> can be
later retrieved with the get function or maybe examined.

Example:              |   Output
===========================================================
                      |
&foo me = bar         |   Set.
                      |
examine me/foo        |   FOO: bar

Also see: examine, get(), @set, &&

& &&
command: 

   &&<attribute> <object> = <text>

This is the multiline version of the @set and & command. Any
commands issued after this command will be added to the end
of attribute's value. Issuing a single blank line will end 
the command. A period on a blank line can be used in place 
of a blank line.
   
Example:              |   Output
===========================================================
                      |
&&foo me = bar        |
bar                   |
.                     |
boo                   |
                      |   Set.
examine me/foo        |   FOO: bar
                      |   biz
                      |
                      |   boo

Also see: examine, get(), @set, &
& :
command: 

   :<message>
 
Performes an action to everyone in your current room. If
there is a space between the ":" and the message, there
will be no space in between your name and your message.
This is also a shortcut for the pose command.


Example:              |   Output
===========================================================
                      |
:smiles               |   Guest smiles
: 's eyes light up.   |   Guest's eyes light up.

Also see: pose
& ;
command:

   ;<message>
 
This command is like the ":" command except that there
is no space inserted between your name and the action.


Example:              |   Output
===========================================================
                      |
;'s eyes light up.    |   Guest's eyes light up.
; 's eyes light up.   |   Guest 's eyes light up.

Also see: pose, :
& @@
command: 

   @@ <text>
 
This command is useful for putting comments into a Mushcode.
The command actually does nothing but makes your code more
readable.

Example:              |   Output
===========================================================
                      |
&&foo me=$dg  *:      |
   @@ Dog Controller  |
   @force #0=%0       |
                      | Set.
dg smiles.            | Dog smiles.
& @boot
command: 

   @boot <player>
   @boot/port <port#>

Disconnects a player from the game. If the player is connected
multiple times, then all connections are disconnected. Optionally,
a port may be specified to be more presice about which connection
is disconnected. Port numbers are listed on the WHO for wizards.

Example:              |   Output
===========================================================
                      |
@boot adrick          | Adrick has been @booted.
                      | Adrick has disconnected.
                      |
@boot/port 1          | Adrick has been @booted.
                      | Adrick has disconnected.

Also see: WHO
& @close
I don't think this command does anything, scheduled for removal or fixing.
& @cls
command: 

   @cls

This command sends a -- line and clear screen command to the console. 
This is useful for debuging output as it happens. Results are not
visible from inside the MUSH.
& @code
command: 

   @code

Lists stats on how big the version of TeenyMUSH is that is
currently running broken down by file. Size is listed in bytes
and lines.
& @commit
command: 

   @commit

Forces a commit to the mysql database. TeenyMUSH typically commits
as needed but occasionally there is a need to force a commit.
This command is wizard only.
& @crash
command: 

   @crash

This forces TeenyMUSH to perform an operation which will crash the
MUSH. A stack trace will be produced on the console and the player
invoking the command. The MUSH will recover from the crash and 
continue on, hopefully. Safe for anyone to use.
& @create
command: 

   @create <name>

Creates a object with the specified name. Objects can be molded
with descriptions, attributes, and flags to be whatever you want. 
Each object gets its own id number. Keep track of this number
as it can help with coding it to do things or find it after it
has been lost.

Example:              |   Output
===========================================================
@create puppet        | Object created as: Puppet(#119o)

See Also: @destroy, @set, @describe
& commands
run: @list commands
& functions
run: @list functions
& @describe
command: 

   @describe <name> = <description>

Sets the description for an object. People will see this description
if they look at the object. An empty description will remove the
description from the object.


Example:               |   Output
============================================================
@describe puppet=Shiny | Set.

look puppet            | Shiny


See Also: @set
& @destroy
command: 

   @destroy <object>

Instantly deletes the object from the MUSH. Opposite of @create.
& @dig
command:

   @dig <name> 
   @dig <name> = <exitlist1> , <exitlist2>

Creates a new room with the specified name. Optionally providing
an exit list can create exits going in and out of the newly created
room in one command. Exit list 1 provides exits going to the room
while exit list 2 provides an exit coming back to your current
location. Multiple exit names can be provided by use of a semi-
colon between exit names.

Example:                |  Output
===============================================================
@dig Hotel              |  Creates a room named Hotel
@dig Hotel=In,Out       |  Creates a room with in and out exits
@dig Hotel=Inn;in,Out;o |  Creates the room with in and out
                           exits with aliases of in and o.

See also: @open, @link
& @doing
command:

   @doing <message>

Sets your @doing message which is visible on the DOING/WHO command.
Use this to tell people what your up to.

See also: DOING, WHO
& @dolist
command:

   @dolist <list> = <action>

Takes a list and runs the code once for every item in the list.
As the code is run, the special symbol ## is replaced with the
current item from the list.

Example:                |  Output
===============================================================
@dolist a b c = say ##  |  You say, "a"
                        |  You say, "b"
                        |  You say, "c"
& @find
command:

   @find
   @find <name>

Lists all the objects that you own or just those who's name contains
<name>.
& @password
command:

   @password <old_password> = <new_password>

   This command change your password. Passwords must contain 8 characters
   or more, contain at least one upper case character, and contain at least
   one numeric character.
& @mail
command:

   @mail                                  : Shows an shortened list of email
   @mail short                            : Shows a count of emails
   @mail <number>                         : Reads one email message
   @mail <person> = <message>             : Sends an email message
   @mail/delete <number>                  : Deletes an email message

   This command is used for displaying or sending email to/from other people.

   ex:
      @mail adrick = testing
      @mail 1
      @mail/delete 1
& @name
command:

   @name <object> = <new_name>

   This changes the name of an <object> to <new_name>. Names may contain
   ansi color codes and use of a seperate @moniker is not required.
& @switch
command:

   @switch[/switch} <string>=<test>,<cmd>,<test>,<cmd>,...,<default_cmd>

   If <string> matches <test>, the command following the <test> is run.
   Only the first match is concerned. If no matches are made, then the
   <default_cmd> is run if it exists.

   <test> may include * wild cards. Text matched by the wildcard maybe
   retrieved using %m0 - %m9. The <test> may also include > and < for
   greater and less then comparisons.

   For readability, the <default_cm> may have an optional preceeding
   <test> of DEFAULT.

   Availible switches:

      /regexp        :   Use regular expression matching instead of
                         simple wildcard matching. All "\" characters
                         will need to be escaped out due to the nature
                         of how MUSH deals with the "\" character.

Example:                                               |  Output
===========================================================================
@switch abc=*b*,say %m0,*e*,say def,DEFAULT,say !match |  You say, "a"
@switch def=*b*,say %m0,*e*,say def,DEFAULT,say !match |  You say, "def"
@switch ghi=*b*,say %m0,*d*,say def,DEFAULT,say !match |  You say, "!match"
@switch ghi=*b*,say %m0,*d*,say def,say !match         |  You say, "!match"
@switch abcde=^ab(.*)e$,say %m0                        |  You say, "cd"

& input()
function:

    input()     : Returns a line of input from a connected socket opened from
                  the @telnet command. If a line of data is not unavailible
                  yet, the function will return "#-1 No data found". If the
                  connection has closed, the function will return 
                  "#-1 Connection Closed".

    input(last) : Returns the last connection's data for the whole MUSH. If
                  the connection is still pending, only partial data will be
                  returned. This is implimented for debug purposes only.

See: @telnet, telnet_open()
& @telnet
command:

   @telnet <hostname> <port>

   Opens a connection to <hostname> on <port> if the object is set either
   SOCKET_PUPPET or SOCKET_INPUT. Both flags are setable by WIZARDS only.

   If the object is set SOCKET_PUPPET, all socket input is matched via a
   ^pattern style listen used by MUSH to match input in the same room as
   an object. However, instead of a "^" the pattern must start with "!"
   to specify a socket based listen.

   If the object is set SOCKET_LISTEN, then all socket input may be
   retrieved by the input() / telnet_open functions.

See: input(), telnet_open(), SOCKET_PUPPET, SOCKET_INPUT, @close
&url
function:

   url(http://address/path)
   url(https://address/path)

      This function is a way to pull web pages via MushCode. It must be used
      within a loop command like @while. The function will return 1 as long
      as the connection is still open or there is data to return. The responce
      from the website may be retrieved from the %{data} variable.

   Error Responces contained in %{data}:

       #-1 CONNECTION FAILED    :   url() was unable to connect to the remote
                                    site.

       #-1 PAGE LOAD FAILURE    :   url connected but the server responded
                                    with a 400 or higher return code.
       #-1 DATA PENDING         :   No data was availible at this time

   Example:

      @while (url(https://www.wowbagger.com/process.php)) {
         @switch %{data}=
            #-1 CONNECTION FAILED,
               say I'm out of insults \[connection failed\],
            #-1 PAGE LOAD FAILURE,
               say =I'm out of insults \[page load failure\],
            #-1 DATA PENDING,
               @@ ignore,
            *customBig>*<*,
               say %m1
      }

& @perl
command:

   @perl <command>

   This invokes <command> via perl's eval() function. <Command> must be
   a valid perl command. Only GOD may run this command.
& entities()
function:

    entities(encode,<txt>)  :  Encodes <txt> with HTML entities.
    entities(decode,<txt>)  :  Decodes <txt> with HTML entities.

Example:
    say entities(encode,<'>)       :  You say, "abc&lt;&#39;&gt;def"
    say entities(encode,&lt;&gt;)  :  You say, "<>"
& match()
function:
    match(<string>,<pattern>)
    match(<string>,<pattern>,<delimiter>)

    Compares each word or segment of the string against the provided pattern
    to see if it matches. If a match occures, the function returns the word
    or segment position that was matched. If no match occures, the function
    will return 0. 

    Patterns may use * to match multiple characters or ? to match a single
    character.

Example:
     say match(abc def,def)               :  You say, "2"
     say match(abc def,*e?)               :  You say, "2"
     say match(funky|abc def|foo,*e*,|)   :  You say, "2"
& @trigger
command:

   @trig <obj>/<attr> 
   @trig <obj>/<attr> = <parm1>,<parm2>, .. <parm9>?

   Runs the commands in the attribute on object. The Parameters are passed
   in via %0 .. %9. You must control the object or the attribute must be
   a $command.
& setunion()
function:
    setunion(<string1>,<string2>,[<delim>,<seperator>,<sort type>])

    Returns <string1> and <string2> after removing duplicate words. The
    results are sorted alphanumerically or by <sort type>. Optionally, a
    delimter and output seperator may be used.

    <Sort type> may be:
        N :  Numberic
        F :  Floating point
        D :  Debref
        A :  Alphanumeric

Example:
     say setunion(a b c d e, d c f)        :  You say, "a b c d e f"
     say setunion(a|b|c|d|e,d|c|f,|,\,)    :  You say, "a,b,c,d,e,f"
     say setunion(#453 #3,#5 #3 #463,,,d)  :  You say, "#3 #5 #453 #463"
& setdiff()
function:
    setdiff(<string1>,<string2>,[<delim>,<seperator>,<sort type>])

    Returns those words in <string1> that are not in <string2>. The
    results are sorted alphanumerically or by <sort type>. Optionally, a
    delimter and output seperator may be used.

    <Sort type> may be:
        N :  Numberic
        F :  Floating point
        D :  Debref
        A :  Alphanumeric

Example:
     say setunion(a b c d e, d c f)        :  You say, "a b c d e f"
     say setunion(a|b|c|d|e,d|c|f,|,\,)    :  You say, "a,b,c,d,e,f"
     say setunion(#453 #3,#5 #3 #463,,,d)  :  You say, "#3 #5 #453 #463"
& lit()
function:
    lit(<string1>,<string2>..., <stringN>)

    Returns the strings as is without any modification. Good for 
    showing code to others?

Example:
     > say lit(say [run(say [run(say [run(say test %b %s %p)])])])

     You say, "say [run(say [run(say [run(say test %b %s %p)])])]"

& @set
command:

   @set object = [!] flag
   @set object/attribute = [!] attribute_flag


   Sets a flag on either an object or attribute.

See: @list flags
& v()
function:
    v(attribute)

    Returns the attribute on the calling object.

Example:
     &foo me = bar
     > say v(foo)

     You say, "bar"
& @sleep
command:

   @sleep <seconds>

   Causes the current running MUSH code to pause <seconds> before continuing
   on. 

Example:
   &foo me = say [time()];@sleep 5;say [time()]
   @trig me/foo

   You say, "Thu Jan 31 12:39:04 2019"
   You say, "Thu Jan 31 12:39:10 2019"

See: @wait
& @wait
command:

   @wait <seconds> = <command>

   Runs <command> after waiting <seconds>. Any commands after the @wait
   command will not wait to be run. 

Example:
   &&foo me = $foo:
      say BEFORE: [time()];
      @wait 5=say MIDDLE: [time()];
      say AFTER: [time()]

   @trig me/foo
   You say, "BEFORE: Thu Jan 31 12:39:04 2019"
   You say, "AFTER: Thu Jan 31 12:39:04 2019"
   You say, "MIDDLE: Thu Jan 31 12:39:10 2019"

See: @sleep
